# Blockchain
Implement a Simple Blockchain in Java  What should be done in this assignment? - You should use the articles linked below as reference to implement a Simple Blockchain in Java -- Multiple miners should run in parallel to insert a block in the chain. -- The chain must accept a new block only if it was generated using the hash of its last block as seed. -- It should be implemented as a Java library and called blockchain.jar. - Create a separate jar using Java Concurrency to simulate multiple miners trying to add new blocks to the chain at the same time. -- It should be implemented as a Java console application called miners.jar.  What do we expect to see in this assignment? - Use Local Variable Type Inference as much as possible. - Use Lambda Expressions along with the Streams API. - Use some of the new features of the Collections API, introduced after Java 8. - Use some Java Concurrency to run multiple miners in parallel.  What should be submitted? - A link to a source code repo where we can browse and evaluate the code. - Log fragments showing the blockchain is operating as expected when multiple miner are executing.
